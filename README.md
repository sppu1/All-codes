Number data type. Implement the following operations:<br>
1. Constructor (including a default constructor which
creates the complex number 0+0i).<br>

    <td>Develop an object-oriented program in C++ to create a
database of student information system containing the
following information: Name, Roll number, Class, division,
Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact address, telephone
number, driving license no. etc.
Construct the databasewith suitable member functions for
initializing and destroying the data viz constructor, this
pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation
operators-new and delete as well as exception handling.</td>

    <td>Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for
book and audio cassette versions. Create a class
publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type
float) of publications. From this class derive two classes:
book which adds a page count (type int) and tape which
adds a playing time in minutes (type float). Write a
program that instantiates the book and tape class, allows
user to enter data and displays the data members. If an
exception is caught, replace all the data member values
with zero values.</td>

The keys will be the names of states and the values will be
the populations of the states. When the program runs, the
user is prompted to type the name of a state. The program
then looks in the map, using the state name as an index and
returns the
population of the state.</td>
